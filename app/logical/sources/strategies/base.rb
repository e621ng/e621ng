# This is a collection of strategies for extracting information about a 
# resource. At a minimum it tries to extract the artist name and a canonical 
# URL to download the image from. But it can also be used to normalize a URL 
# for use with the artist finder. 
#
# Design Principles
#
# In general you should minimize state. You can safely assume that <tt>url</tt>
# will not change over the lifetime of an instance,
# so you can safely memoize methods and their results. A common pattern is
# conditionally making an external API call and parsing its response. You should
# make this call on demand and memoize the response.
