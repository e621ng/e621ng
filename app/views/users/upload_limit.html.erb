<h2>Upload Limit</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <% unless CurrentUser.can_upload_free? %>
    <p>You can currently upload <strong><%= CurrentUser.upload_limit %></strong> posts. This limit is based on the following formula:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Approved: <%= @approved_count %></li>
      <li>Deleted: <%= @deleted_count %></li>
      <li>Pending/Flagged: <%= @pending_count %></li>
      <li>Formula: <%= @presenter.upload_limit(self)%></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This means you are able to upload a maximum of <span style='font-weight:bold'><%= CurrentUser.upload_limit %></span> unapproved posts at a time.
      Once a moderator approves some of your posts, you can upload more.<br />
      You cannot upload anything within the first week of registration.<br />
      If your limit ends up negative due to a large number of deleted posts, please contact <%= Danbooru.config.contact_email %> to have it corrected.
    </p>
  <% end %>

  <p>
    <% unless CurrentUser.can_upload_free? %>
      In addition to this, you are limited to 30 uploads per hour.
      You also may not upload if you have no remaining tag edits per hour.
    <% else %>
      You are limited to 30 uploads per hour.
    <% end %>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Remaining hourly uploads: <%= CurrentUser.hourly_upload_limit %></li>
    <% if !CurrentUser.can_upload_free? %><li>Remaining hourly tag edits: <%= CurrentUser.post_edit_limit %></li><% end %>
  </ul>

  <% unless CurrentUser.can_upload_free? %>
    <p>
      If either of these limits reaches zero, you may not upload until some time has passed and these limits increase automatically.
