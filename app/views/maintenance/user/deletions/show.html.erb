    <h1>Delete Account</h1>

    <p>You can delete your account. This will not actually remove your account from the database, but it will do the following things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Rename your account to a generic name</li>
      <li>Lock your account</li>
      <li>Remove all your favorites</li>
      <li>Blank out your settings (including email)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This will not do any of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Remove uploads you have made to the site</li>
      <li>Remove comments/forum topics/blips/wiki pages/sets/pools you have made</li>
      <li>Remove the history of changes made by your account for any portion of the site</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You must enter your password to delete your account. Accounts cannot be deleted until they have existed for at least one week.</p>
