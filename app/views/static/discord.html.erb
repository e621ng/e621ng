  <p>e621 has a discord server where you can chat with other e621 users. All site rules apply in the discord server.
    There is no voice chat, and there never will be.</p>
  <h4>In order to limit access to the server to e621 members we have employed a system where you must authorize e621 to
    join the server on your behalf. You will be asked to authorize the "E621 Joiner" application to do this.</h4>
  <p>Once you have joined the server this authorization serves no purpose and you can safely deauthorize the application
    if you wish to.</p>
